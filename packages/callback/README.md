# @byu-oit/openapi.callback

>This package exposes the Callback Object from the `@byu-oit/openapi.pathitem` package. The source code is located in
that package because the PathItem, Operation, and Callback Objects all depend on one another and circular references in
NPM are not allowed.

### Usage

<!-- TODO: Copy PathItem Object usage to this package.>
